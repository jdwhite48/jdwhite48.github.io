				<h3 class="display-4">Applied cryptography, and other randomness...</h3>
				<br>
				<p>Hello, and welcome to my blog! Here you might find me musing about a wide range of topics including cryptography, human factors (e.g., UI/UX), programming languages, math, music, other nerdy and senseless ramblings: really, anything that's on my mind that doesn't want to stay that way...</p>
 
				<p>I don't claim to be an expert in most (or any...) of the topics covered in these posts; my goal here is to motivate and demonstrate my <i>own</i> learning just as much as it is to share information&mdash;usually in a more approachable manner than <a href="publications.html">related</a> research papers&mdash;which supports others'. Also, don't expect to see me talk much about my personal life here... I'll leave that to other communication channels. (is this a relief? disappointment? I'll let you decide that :)</p>
